This is the repository that you will be working with throughout the school year. It is important to remember that you need to fork it by pressing the "Fork" button on the top right corner of your screen. Forking means that this repository will be copied exactly and remade as a repository under your ownership and control. This is best practice to avoid conflicting commits.
